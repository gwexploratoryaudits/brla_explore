% This script computes the parameters of a B2 audit needed to design
% a corresponding R2 audit. It is intended for use when time 
% is not an issue: between election results and audit. 
%
% The script generates n and kmin using function B2BRAVOkmin, 
% then the risk schedule using B2Risks. 
%
% n and the corresponding risk schedule are the only variables needed for 
% an R2 audit. They are denoted nB2 and RiskSchedB2.

%Input: 
%   margin:         election margin for BSquareBRAVO and the stopping
%                       probs. 
%   alpha:          risk limit
%   N:              election size
%	audit_type:     0 (with replacement)/anything else (without)
