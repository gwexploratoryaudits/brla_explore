# Improving Round Size Estimates by Considering Irrelevant Ballots in Stopping Probability Calculations

> When auditing election results, election officials often want to only have to draw one round of ballots instead of continuing to go back a draw more and more rounds. Because of this, we provide round size estimates that give estimations of how many ballots must be drawn in a round in order to have a certain percent chance of the audit stopping. The stopping probability of a certain round is the probability of drawing kmin or greater number of ballots for the winner, where kmin is the minimum number of ballots for the winner for the round size that satisfies the audits stopping condition (read brla_explore and R2Audits READMEs for more detail). But, in a real election, there is the added possibility of irrelevant/invalid ballots, which we must consider when caluclating the stopping probabilites and round size estimates.
