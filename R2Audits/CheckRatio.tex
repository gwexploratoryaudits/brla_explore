    % not smaller than percentiles(j).

    % Input:
    %   cdf:            row array of non-decreasing values

    % Output: 
    %   values:         row array of size of percentiles, identifies
    %                       index into CDF which marks the first element
    %                       whose value is not smaller than the
    %                       corresponding value of percentiles
    % ----------
