    %       number of expected ballots drawn 
    % for a round-by-round audit defined by a round schedule n and a 
    % corresponding kmin schedule kmin, applied to an election defined 
    % by margin and total size N).
    % Note that, if margin=0, it returns: 
    %       round-by-round risk schedule
    %       total risk
    %       number of expected ballots drawn (for this case, a sanity check)
    %----------
    % Input Values: 
    %   margin:         announced margin as a fraction for stopping probs;
    %                   zero for risk calculations
    %   N:              votes cast for two candidates; 
    %   n:              row vector of cumulative sample sizes (round schedule)
    %                       last round size no larger than N for audits 
    %                       without replacement
    %   kmin:           row vector of same size as n
    %   audit_type:     0 for with, or 1 for without, replacement
    %
    %   n and kmin are typically outputs of R2BravoLikekmin or 
    %   R2BRAVOkmin using margin, alpha (and N) when margin is not 
    %   zero. the jth value of kmin is the minimum number of votes for 
    %   winner required to terminate the audit round of size n(j). 
    %----------
    % Output Values
    %   RiskSched:          array of individual risk values. jth value is

    %                           n(j) ballots, round-by-round.                      
    %   RiskValue:          the risk computed as the sum of all values of 
    %                           the risk sched.
    %   ExpectedBallots:	expected number of ballots examined

    % The right tail of the pdf at a round is the risk of the round, when
    % the pdf represents the underlying vote distribution.

    % a tied election.

    % tied election. 
    % Similarly, stopping probability is the right tail of the distribution
