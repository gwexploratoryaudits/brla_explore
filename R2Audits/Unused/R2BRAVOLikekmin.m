    % [n_out, kmin, LLR] = R2BRAVOLikekmin(margin, alpha, N, n_in)
    % Generates kmin for a R2 (round-by-round) BRAVO-like (BRAVO

    %----------
    % Input: 
    %   margin:         fractional margin
    %   alpha:          fractional risk limit
    %   N:              votes cast for two candidates
    %   n_in:           (cumulative) round schedule
    %----------
    % Output:
    %   n_out:          1-D array of sample sizes, subset of given n_in, 
    %                       beginning with the first sample size where 
    %                       it is possible to stop the audit: 
    %                       n_out(j)>=kmin(j).
    %   kmin:           1-D array of minimum values of k; jth value is the 
    %                       minimum number of votes for winner required to 
    %                       terminate an audit with sample size n(j). Thus 
    %                       kmin, like n, is cumulative. 
    %   LLR:            array of values of the log-likelihood ratio (LLR), 
    %                       sanity check. 

    % HalfN is maximum votes for announced winner if the election outcome 
    % is incorrect. That is, half the total votes if N is even, and a 
    % losing margin of one if N is odd.
    HalfN = floor(N/2);
    
    LogAlpha = log(alpha); % log of the risk limit;
    
    p = (1+margin)/2; % fractional vote count for winner
    
    WinnerTally = floor(p*N); % number of votes obtained by winner
    
    LoserTally = N-WinnerTally; % number of votes obtained by loser

    %--------------------
    % We compute the LLR and compare it to -LogAlpha
    % k: array of number of votes for winner in samples
    % j: array of sample sizes
    % LLR: array of actual LLR for the kmin (sanity check, 
    %           differs from prescribed values because kmin is integer, but  
    %           LLR should not be smaller than -LogAlpha). 

    % For sample j, for each possible value of k beginning at 
    % kmin(j-1), denoted kminprev here to accommodate j=1, we determine 
    % the LLR. We stop when it is not smaller than -LogAlpha.
