''' A program which calculates the probability of stopping at each audit round when provided
    the number of ballots cast for two candidates in a two candidate election, the round schedule,
    the k_mins, and a true tally.

    Crucially, if the true tally is set to a tie (or margin of 1 in favor of the reported loser) then the
    sum of the stopping probabilities is the risk limit of the provided set of k_mins! '''
