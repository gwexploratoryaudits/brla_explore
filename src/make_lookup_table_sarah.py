Generating lookup table for Bayesian RLA using binary search

Bayesian RLA uses a prior distribution which is uniform on tallies favoring
the winner and concentrated on a margin of one for tallies favoring the loser.

To generate lookup table for an election, edit the parameters within the main
method: total_votes, audit_rounds, and risk_limits.

"""Generate lookup table for an election with:

    @param total_votes: Total number of votes cast in a given election.

    @param audit_rounds: Array (or list) of escalating audit round sizes.
    The audit will begin with a sample of size audit_rounds[0] and either stop
    (if stopping criterion is met), or progress on to audit_rounds[1]
    (which should be double audit_rounds[0]), and so on.

    @param: risk_limits: Array (or list) of risk limits for which we will
    generate minimum stopping vote counts.

    @return: 2D Array (List) of integers where each row corresponds to a risk
    limit and each column corresponds to an audit round. The table contains the
    minimum number of votes for the announced winner needed to stop the audit
    for a given risk limit and sample size (audit round).

Error is calcualted using a prior distribution (as described above)

    stop < audit.

    be taken during audit.

    @param total_votes: Total number of votes in election. Used for calcualting
    distributions.
