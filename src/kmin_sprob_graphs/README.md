# One-round Convolution Audits vs. BRAVO
## k_min values and stopping probability comparisons

Each of the included graphs was generated by one_round_stopping_probs.py

All elections had 100,000 total votes cast. The naming convention describes the elections compared in the graphs as follows.

risk-r-margin-m-rounds-a-b.png
- r: risk-limit of audit
- m: reported margin of election
- a-b: range of round sizes

Example: risk-10-margin-10-rounds-100-3200.png
- N = 100,000 total votes
- 10% risk limit
- 10% reported margin for winner
- Rounds from 100 to 3200
