    "<h1> An Application of Athena Methods to Batch Comparison Audits </h1> \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates a straightforward application of some of the methods described in <em>The Athena Class of Risk-Limiting Ballot Polling Audits</em> (Zagórski et al, https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02315) to a scheme for batch comparison audits as in <em>Conservative Statistical Post-Election Audits</em> (Stark, https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aoas/1215118528). The code is exploratory, as it does not address multiple candidates, multiple contests, nor does it attempt to apply Athena to the more complex (and more efficient!) Kaplan-Markov method in <em>Risk Limiting Postelection Audits: Conservative </em>P<em>-values From Common Probability Inequalities</em> (Stark, https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/pvalues09.pdf)."

    "We begin with notation, which is largely borrowed from Stark's papers (above), but can be simplified because of our consideration of only the two-candidate case. An election has $N$ precincts (or batches), and has a reported margin $M$. Each precinct $p$ has a true (absolute) error $e_p$, which is intuitively understood as the reduction in the margin that occurs when rectifying the batch total. A value of $e_p = 0$ means the batch total was correct; $e_p < 0$ means the batch erred in the direction of favoring the reported winner; $e_p > 0$ means the batch erred in the direction of favoring the reported loser. Let $v_{pw}$ and $v_{pl}$ be the reported tallies in precinct $p$ for the reported winner and reported loser, respectively, and $a_{pw}$ and $a_{pl}$ be the true tallies in precinct $p$ for the reported winner and reported loser, respectively. Then $e_p$ = $(v_{pw} - v_{pl}) - (a_{pw} - a_{pl})$. Let $u_p$ be a hard upper bound for $e_p$. This may involve a physical element, for example, how many ballots were shipped to the precinct."

    "Risk-limting audits must devise and assume the worst-case election, that is, the election that is incorrectly called but most difficult to discern as incorrect. In ballot-polling audits, this generally means assuming the underlying tally is a tie, because that is hardest to differentiate from the reported margin (which will be $> .5$). In our case, it means assuming as few precincts as possible carry just enough error to close the margin. We denote by $x$ the fewest number of precincts that could flip the outcome: $x := |U_i|$, where $U_i$ is the smallest list of errors (true or upper bound) satisfying $\\sum_{r \\in U_i} r \\geq M$, where each $r$ is either $e_p$ or $u_p$ for some precinct $p$. The computation of $x$ is somewhat complicated when we let each batch make a small \"tolerance\" error."
